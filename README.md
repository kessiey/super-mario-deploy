# Step 3: Cluster Provision

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kessiey/super-mario-deploy.git
   ```

2. **Change Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd k8s-mario
   ```

3. **Provide Executable Permission and Run Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x script.sh
   ./script.sh
   ```

   This script installs Terraform, AWS CLI, kubectl, and Docker. Check versions:
   ```
   docker --version
   aws --version
   kubectl version --client
   terraform --version
   ```

4. **Change Directory to EKS-TF**:
   ```
   cd EKS-TF
   ```

5. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

   **Note**: Don‚Äôt forget to change the S3 bucket name in the `backend.tf` file.

6. **Validate and Plan Terraform**:
   ```
   terraform validate
   terraform plan
   ```

7. **Provision Cluster**:
   ```
   terraform apply --auto-approve
   ```

   Completed in 10 minutes.

8. **Update Kubernetes Configuration**:
   - Make sure to change your desired region.
   ```
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name EKS_CLOUD --region us-east-2
   ```

9. **Change Directory Back to k8s-mario**:
   ```
   cd ..
   ```

10. **Apply Deployment and Service**:
    **Deployment**:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

    Check the deployment:
    ```
    kubectl get all
    ```

    **Service**:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    ```

    Check the service:
    ```
    kubectl get all
    ```

11. **Describe Service and Copy LoadBalancer Ingress**:
    ```
    kubectl describe service mario-service
    ```

    Paste the ingress link in a browser to play the Mario game.
